# AI Classes Landing Page

## Overview
This project is a modern, minimal, and professional landing page for promoting AI adaptation skills and classes. It is designed to be clean, scalable, and easy to customize for personal or business branding. The page is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is fully responsive for all devices.

## Features
- Professional hero section with a business-focused illustration
- Clear call-to-action for AI class registration
- About section describing the mission and offering
- Contact form for inquiries
- Animated SVG wave background for visual depth
- Responsive and accessible design
- Easy to customize and extend

## File Structure
```
Class AI/
├── testing.html      # Main HTML file for the landing page
├── main.css          # All styles for layout, animation, and responsiveness
├── main.js           # JavaScript for interactivity (modal, nav, hero effects)
└── README.md         # This documentation file
```

## Customization
- **Hero Image:** Replace the `src` in the `<img class="hero-image">` tag in `testing.html` with your own illustration or photo.
- **Colors & Fonts:** Edit `main.css` to change the color palette or font family to match your brand.
- **Content:** Update the text in `testing.html` to reflect your own story, mission, and offerings.
- **Contact Form:** The form is currently a front-end only demo. Integrate with a backend or service (like Formspree) for real submissions.
- **Add Sections:** You can add testimonials, FAQ, or more services by extending the HTML and CSS.

## Deployment
You can deploy this landing page on any static hosting service (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel):
1. Upload all files (`testing.html`, `main.css`, `main.js`, and any assets) to your host.
2. Set `testing.html` as the main entry point (rename to `index.html` if needed).
3. Share your link!
